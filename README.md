## About program

The program is a website that allows the user to input a project of any variety. It takes a input of some sort to store; project name, owner name, title, description, and etc... It will evaluate the information inputed and see so that no invalid input can be added. It will then display a table of your projects and you are able to then save, append, load to local storage, edit and delete any projects you would like.

All that needs to be done one the users side is to type the right information and press the corresponding buttons to what you would like to do and enjoy using the site.
